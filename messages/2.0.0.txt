# FileIcons Mono 2.0.0

In this latest version of FileIcons Mono,
we've changed the icon files to pure white. 

This allows full control over the color and contrast of the icons. 
Of course we updated our built-in support for the default themes.
To update your custom theme, adjust the "layer0.tint" to your taste.
